# Group Retro

## What is a Retrospective?  
A meeting where the project team is able to reflect on the past project or sprint (used in Agile project management). The team identifies specific things to stop doing, continue doing, & start doing, in order to create a plan for improvements to be enacted for the next project or sprint.


## Setting the Stage:
Welcome everyone to the retrospective meeting and establish the rules of engagement:
- Embrace a positive spirit of continuous improvement and share whatever you think will help the team improve.
- Don't make it personal, don't take it personally.
- Listen with an open mind, and remember that everyone's experience is valid (even those you don't share).
- Set the boundary of your discussion – is it that last sprint? the last quarter? since the project started? Be clear how far back you're going to go.
- Encourage the team to embrace an improvement mindset, away from blame.


## Steps:
### 1. What went well in the Sprint?  
- Start the session on a positive note. Have each team member use green sticky notes to write down what they feel went well (one idea per sticky). As people post their stickies on the whiteboard, the facilitator should group similar or duplicate ideas together.

- Discuss your ideas briefly as a team.

### 2. What could be improved?  
- Same structure as above, but using pink or red stickies. 
- Remind your team that this is about actions and outcomes – not about specific people.

### 3. What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?  
- Having identified what didn't go so well, what concrete actions can the team take to improve those things? Have your team use blue sticky notes to place ideas on the board. Group them and then discuss as a team, agree to which actions you will take, assign owners and a due date to get them DONE.

- Thank everyone for their involvement and their honesty. Quickly run through the list of follow-up items, their owners and due dates.


## Remember:
- We are all here to learn an get better and grow together. This is a time to practice giving actionable feedback and learning how to listen to feedback.  

- You are not your code.
