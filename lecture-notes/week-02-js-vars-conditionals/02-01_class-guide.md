# Tier 1 Week 2 Remote Class Guide

Week 2 class is remote via Go To Meeting.

## Remote Class Etiquette

- Show your faces (not required, but helps us put names and faces together)
 - Mute your microphone when you are not speaking
 - Feel free to ask quesions through the chat window (or verbally)
 - We will have time for Q&A at the end

## Whatâ€™s going on at Prime

- What are the other cohorts doing?
- Does Prime have any upcoming events?

## One on Ones!

- Weeks 3 and 4, we will be holding one one ones with all students.
- These are mandatory, it's a chance to check in with each of you. We will talk about how things are going and if you need anything. There is nothing you need to do in advance to prepare, just come ready to talk about how things are going so far and if you have any concerns.
- You will sign up for a 30-min slot (the link to sign up will be in Slack tomorrow). The one on one doesn't need to take 30 minutes. They sometimes take as little as 10 minutes, depending on how the conversation goes.
- One on One will be done on video call (Zoom).
- Reach out on Slack if you have any questions.

## Encourage people to work together
- Tutoring
- Result of poll - when will we be hosting a study group?
- Any planned study groups? 
- This week's content (and going forward) will get more challenging, so please reach out if you need help.

## Learning Advice: Read, Write, Speak, Teach

- Dev's videos, documentation and tutorials are part of the "Read" skill
    - Resources: Extra learning, things to "Read" or reference.
- The assignments are the "Write" skill
    - You need to write code to learn it
    - Be careful not to get stuck in the "Read" state. Get into the discomfort and errors of "Write".
    - Recommended: Write Practice with less guidance and frameworks. Practice logic and problem solving in Javascript. 
- Work with others can help exercise the read, speak, teach skills. 

## Content Notes

- Week 1 covered tools and getting familiar with them:
  - mac/computer
  - terminal
  - browser/dev tools
  - Atom/editor
  - git

- This week we are cracking open Javascript, which is a computer language, used to write web programs.
