# Using Calendly

Calendly is a tool to help schedule preset blocks of time that allows anyone to find an open time and book it. This can be useful for scheduling 20+ short meetings like the Tier 1 one on ones with students.

Calendly creates the events on your Google calendar for you with the person's name and details.

1. Create [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) for 1:1s
    - Use your work Google account so it links to your calendar
        - Calendar must be FREE for the 1-1 meeting spots to be visible to students
            - If you want blocks to show before meetings scheduled, set visibility to Free
            - Busy times automatically sync and don't show as availble for students
    - Setup "New Event Type" for meetings
        - Location:
            - tiny link for `let invitee decide`
            - Customize
        - 30 min time blocks
        - Customize available time slots by day/times available for students
            - Recommend avoiding Mondays (grading)
            - Consider skewing more times in week 4 (or even early W5)
            - Later 1-1's dates give more time to see student HW scores & work patterns
2. Post Calendly and track responses
    - Prioritize any students struggling or with special circumstances
        - Meeting sooner better than later
        - Reach out individually to encourage scheduling
