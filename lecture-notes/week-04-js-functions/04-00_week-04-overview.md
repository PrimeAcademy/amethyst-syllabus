## Slack Discussion

One way to think of functions are as tiny programs. They can take some input as an argument, do some processing, and return some output.

As an example in the videos we examined a "fill the mug" function that could take 3 types of drinks. It would then return a mug filled with a mix of those drinks.

> What real world actions you do regularly could be explained as a function? Describe them in terms of input (arguments received by the function), processing (the logic within the function), and output (what is returned by the function).
