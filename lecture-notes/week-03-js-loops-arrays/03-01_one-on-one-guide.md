# Tier 1 One on Ones

## Who

One instructor and one student.

## Format

Schedule 30 mins. Can be in person or video call. Phone call can work as well if there is a reason to skip video.

## Preparation

Review assignment score trends, feedback if low scores. Looking at their application resumes can be a handy way to find things to talk about and get to know the cohort.

## Take Notes

Take notes in the 1:1 tab in this cohort's Google Spreadsheet.

## Topics

Allow the student to tell you how things are going so far. This may get into technical questions or talking about the assignments.

## Instructor Questions

- Allow any other questions about the program, cohort, pace, material, etc. 
- What do you do with the feedback, have you gone back and updated your work, etc
- Are you working in Tier 1 and if so, how much? (hours)
- When are you working on the content?
    - You are looking to reinforce working some every single day
- Extra practice if they are feeling good about Prime's content:
    - stick to JS (vs another language)
    - logic practice (edabit, codewars, etc)
        - this will practice JS basics (loops, arrays, if/else logic) as well as flex your logical thinking and comprehension
        - you cannot practice logic enough as a programmer
        - logic will be a part of getting a job
