# Heroku

See [docs for deploying to Heroku](../supporting-documentation/deploy-heroku.md).

You may have already deployed a Node.js app to Heroku. This week you will also need to:

- [Deploy a postgres database with bit.io](../supporting-documentation/bit-io.md)
- [Connect your heroku app to the bit.io database](../supporting-documentation/bit-io.md#connect-to-your-database-from-heroku).
