## Welcome

We're so excited to have you here at Prime!


## What to Expect From Tier 1

- Tier 1 operates much differently than Tiers 2 and 3. 

The purpose of Tier 1 is to get everyone on the same page and teach you programming fundamentals that will benefit you in class. It's remote, and the time commitment is around 20 hours/week, but it's important that you have a good grasp of the Tier 1 content before entering Tier 2.

- Software Engineering is hard, Prime is hard, and impostor syndrome is normal.
    - Impostor syndrome = the internal monologue that you're a fraud, and that you have fooled others into thinking that you are more intelligent than you believe you are. Or, that you have fooled us into letting you into the program.
    - When you are feeling this way, we would rather you reach out to us to talk about it, rather than allowing it to send you into a spiral. 
- Industry is based on trial and error
    - Many times, we will ask you to try writing code for things you might not yet understand. That trial and error is a huge part of learning.
- We're here to help
    - We're all a team, but that means letting us know when you're struggling instead of hiding it
- Support networks are vital
- Sleep/rest/health are important

## Expectations We Have For You

[Review Syllabus and Schedule](./README.md)


### So In Summary

- Communication
    - Proactive communication is KEY
    - If you're going to be late, if you need help, if you need anything, communicate with us
    - Treat this like a job, let us know what's going on or if you're going to miss time in class
- Complete All Work
    - Even if the assignment isn't done or working the way you want, still attempt it and turn it in
    - If you get stuck, come up with detailed questions to where you're stuck
    - We can't give feedback without seeing what you've written
- Don't Get Behind
    - Prime moves so fast, let us know if you're getting behind before it becomes a concern.
- We're Here For You
    - Don't try to trick us into thinking you understand the content if you don't
    - We are here to help you, so take advantage of that help while you're here

### No Failing Silently:

- The goal of Prime/Tier 1 is not to have you struggle alone / fail silently.
    - Cohorts that work together tend to be the most successful
    - Exposing your ignorance (communicating what you DO NOT know) is key, even *after* you've graduated from Prime. It cannot be overstated how critical this behavior is.
    - If possible, try to get to know some of your classmates before Tier 2 starts
- I am generally available during Prime hours to help
    - Please send me a Slack message if you would like some help and we can schedule a time
- Study Groups
    - We will host one at Prime weekly from weeks 2-6 of Tier 1.
    - Look for a poll in your cohort's Slack channel to select a day, once that has happened, I will reserve a conference room on campus
    - If you're planning on studying (whether on campus or elsewhere), feel free to put that in Slack as well, you are free to set up as many study groups as you would like

## Slack Tour and Demo (make into a video?)

- First and last name for username
- Profile photo 
    - So we can put names/faces together as quickly as possible
- Cohort channel
    - Weekly Slack discussion questions are answered here
    - Ask for help in your cohort channel, rather than directly to another student of an instructor. Someone else may have the same question.
        - Sharing knowledge is a key to success
    - We may not check Slack on evenings/weekends, so you can send us questions/messages, but just know we might not respond immediately
    - Have Slack open when working on things for Prime, and also check it every day or two.
        - Get the app for your phone and desktop
- How to join channels
- How to reply in a thread
- How to DM
- All Prime Slack
    - You will be getting a second invitation from Slack, for the all Prime community Slack workspace
    - This will be less important for you to check now, but will become more important as you go through the program and start looking for jobs

## Tier 1 Curriculum Website

- There is a tab for each week
- Left sidebar contains class reminder, weekly Slack discussion question, assignment portal link and contact info
- Main section
    - Starts with intro to week's content
    - Video content, including Practical Teamwork
        - Watch the videos before attempting the homework
        - Watch the videos even if it's review, it covers our preferred code style
        - Feel free to follow along with the videos and write the code, this will help you learn the content
    - Survey
        - You will also be doing feedback in Tiers 2 and 3
        - I read the feedback every week
    - Additional Resources

## Demonstrate Student Assignment in Portal

Use the [staging site](https://primeportalqa.herokuapp.com/#/) for a demo.

Student login credentials are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzQLVGNab_4bNhe1Eje_GhkTr8Xd0HbtoqJLG0jzBEM).


### Details

- This is where you will find your assignments throughout the program, and where you will be submitting them
- Username and password is the same as when you applied
  - Reach out ASAP if you have login issues
- The rest of the Tier 1 assignments will generally be assigned by Noon on Monday and are due at 11:59pm Sunday.
- Check for feedback/scores on assignments
    - Grading is usually done by Wednesday/Thursday
    - I don't start grading until Monday, so turning your assignment in early does not mean you will get feedback early
    - Grading Explanation
        - Meets Expectations: You have completed all required steps (and maybe some stretch goals) for the assignment and you work shows that you have an understanding of the week's content
        - Exceeds Expectations: You have completed all required steps and stretch goals for an assignment. Your code looks good, and is implemented correctly
        - Reinforcement Needed: You either missed required steps for the assignment or your work indicates that you may need more work to gain an understanding of the material
            - When you get this score, I will request that you update the assignment with the feedback I provided, get it working as expected
            - After your assignment is updated and working, push it to GitHub and send me a Slack message that it has been updated so I can provide further feedback.
    - One thing to keep in mind is that scores are only meant to give you and your instructors an idea of what you are understanding, not a pass/fail thing, no GPA, not shared with potential employers
    - Feedback will go through specific things that looked good, or could use more work.
    - Assignments will not be re-scored

## Office Hours

Office Hours are official instructor availability on Zoom. No appointment or RSVP needed. Students may stop in and ask questions, work together, or just hang out.

### Week 1 Office Hours

The next class won't be until Thursday of next week so you need to have 2 hours of Office Hours for Week 1.

- TODO: Schedule Two one-hour office hours chunks for *this week* (Week 1)
- Instructor ultimately decides when these will be. We recommend Wed/Thurs/Friday
- Held in our Zoom Classroom
- Instructor will be available to answer questions for one hour

OPTIONS

- You may set up more time than this
- You may also set up Office Hours for the following weeks of Tier 1

---

## Weekly Study Groups

Beyond official instructor office hours, encourage and help students find times to work together and meet up in the Zoom classroom. It is "always open" and working together and getting to know each other is critical for success at Prime.

**These are for students and DIFFERENT than Office Hours**

- Taking a [Slack poll](./01-01_slack-messages.md) is a great way to make sure students will have the opportunity to join
- Set up 2 times, put them on the calendar and let students know
- You may jump into these to say 'hi' if you would like

---

## Tech (if there's time)

- Forking/cloning workflow

## Q&A

## Next Steps

- Next week's class will be over video, using Zoom

- Link/info will be in Slack by Wednesday afternoon
    - In info there is a link to check your connection, please do this before the class and let me know if you have questions
    - There is an option to call in over the phone, but we don't recommend this unless it's the only option available, you can't see the video and aren't included in attendance
- *Classes are required, we track attendance*
