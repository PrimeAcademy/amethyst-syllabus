## Channel Intro, what to do Day 1

@channel Welcome [TODO: COHORT]! :tada: My name is [TODO: INSTRUCTOR] and I will be one of your points of contact for the next 6 weeks for Tier 1. [TODO: INSRTUCTOR -- insert your great feelings of joy and enthusiasm here]!

This first week is a little different from the rest of Tier 1. We'll have orientation *and* our first class today at [TODO: INSTRUCTOR]!

We'll kick things off and talk about your first assignment!

**Your TODOs for today:** You'll get an email with some tasks to complete, including an Onboarding form in which you will need to include your GitHub username. We need this to get you set-up on our GitHub Team, so please do the Onboarding form right away.

Looking forward to meeting you all!. Please reach out to me with questions!
